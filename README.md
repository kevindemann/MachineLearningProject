# MachineLearningProject
### The goal of our project is to create a classifier for handwritten digits. We will use a multi-layer perceptron for this. 
### The plan is to train it using an older version of the MNIST data set, but that is subject to change.


## Setup
1. `python -m venv venv`
2. `./venv/activate.ps1`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
